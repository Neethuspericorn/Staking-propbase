                    <p>Propbase takes the privacy of its Users very seriously. Please read Propbases’ Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference, for information relating to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
                    
                    <h4>OUR PRODUCTS:</h4>
                    <h5>THE PROPBASE PROTOCOL</h5>
                    <p>The Propbase Protocol is a decentralized protocol on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Aptos, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets (the "Propbase Protocol" or the "Protocol"). The Protocol currently has one version, designated as v0.9, which comprises open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts deployed on various public blockchains, such as Aptos. Propbase does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on any blockchain network.</p>
                    <p>The Protocol is initially deployed on the Aptos blockchain and will be deployed on several other blockchain networks, including by parties other than Propbase. Deployments on other networks typically make use of cross-chain bridges, which allow assets native to one blockchain to be transferred to another blockchain. Please note that digital assets that have been "bridged" or "wrapped" to operate on other blockchain networks (including to blockchains compatible with the Move Virtual Machine (Aptos)) are distinct from the original Aptos mainnet asset.</p>
                    <p>As a general matter, Propbase is not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools, and liquidity providers are independent third parties</p>
                    
                    <h5>THE PROPBASE INTERFACE</h5>
                    <p>The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of access to the Propbase Protocol. It is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us, and we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol.</p>
                    <p>When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity providers for the Protocol and to Propbase. However, the fees to Propbase only accrue if using the Propbase platform to initiate orders. No assets on Propbase are controlled by Propbase. As such, users can initiate peer-to-peer trade off-platform or by interacting directly with the smart contracts, without paying any fees to Propbase.</p>
                    <p>Propbase is a decentralized platform powered by blockchain technologies for real estate tokenization, enabling the tokenization, operation, transfer, and storage of ownership of any real estate property.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is to provide Users with quality Services, which include:</p>
                    <div class="li-block">
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>CREATING A MARKETPLACE</b> for tokenized assets where Users can purchase already tokenized real estate that generates profit from rent and become a shareholder of that real estate by receiving asset tokens which give the possibility to govern property decisions.</li>
                            <li><b>ALLOWING USERS TO GOVERN</b> owned assets by creating proposals and voting for those created by other holders' proposals, decisions of which will be handled by property management.</li>
                            <li><b>TRANSFERRING, TRADING, AND</b> of owned assets between other registered users on the interface.                                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h5>PROPBASE STAKING PROTOCOL</h5>
                    <p>The Interface offers staking for cryptocurrency, enabling clients who hold cryptocurrency to stake and restake them directly on a decentralized protocol with self-executing smart contracts. Your staking, including the accrual of any rewards and conversion of any rewards, will be dealt with in accordance with, and governed by, this agreement.</p>
                    <p>You represent and warrant that:</p>

                        <p>(b) Blockchain technology and the underlying staking features are currently in the early development stage and have not been proven to be without error.

                        <p>(c) You have relied on your own review of the Documentation and obtained your own legal, financial, or taxation advice in making a decision to participate in Staking;</p>

                    <h4>4. REAL ESTATE SALES PROCESS</h4>
                    <p>Propbase functions as a marketplace that facilitates connections between buyers (token holders) and sellers (individuals wishing to sell their properties). The Platform advertises real estate properties but does not engage in the purchase, flipping, or resale of properties on the Website.</p>
                    <p>The standard procedure for selling real estate on the Platform comprises the following steps:</p>
                    <div class="li-block">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Property Submission: Sellers submit their properties on the Propbase marketplace for consideration. The property undergoes an evaluation and may be approved or denied based on various factors, including occupancy, condition, location, rental history, and other pertinent criteria.</li>
                            <li>Property Tokenization: Upon approval, the property is placed under contract by a newly formed LLC, effectively tokenizing the property. Property Tokenization involves creating an on-chain legal entity using smart contracts and issuing digital tokens that represent shares in the created entity, thereby allowing token holders to participate in governance through a specific property DAO.</li>
                            <li>Property Inspection: A professional property inspection company conducts a comprehensive inspection and provides a detailed report on the property's condition. If repairs are necessary, the seller must either complete the repairs before closing or provide a credit to the LLC. The inspection covers both interior and exterior elements, including the foundation, structural components, roof, plumbing, and electrical systems.</li>
                            <li>Listing on Marketplace: The tokenized property is then listed on the Propbase marketplace. This process involves executing an agreement to sell the property on the marketplace, thereby making it available for purchase by prospective buyers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>As the provider of the Services, Propbase does not own, control, offer, or manage any real estate. Propbase is not a party to the contracts directly entered into between Users and does not act as a real estate broker or insurer. The Company does not serve as an agent in any capacity for any User.</p>
                    <p>Users are solely responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations with third parties related to their transactions on the Platform.</p>
                    <h5>REAL ESTATE TOKEN PURCHASE</h5>
                    <p>When a user purchases a real estate token on our platform, a Token Purchase Agreement is automatically generated and uploaded to their account. By purchasing the real estate token, the user agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions outlined in the Token Purchase Agreement. It is the user's responsibility to review and understand the terms of the Token Purchase Agreement before completing the purchase. The platform will not be liable for any losses or damages incurred by the user due to their failure to review and understand the terms of the Token Purchase Agreement.</p>

                    <h4>5. FEES AND TAXES</h4>
                    <p>We will charge the fees for the Services provided to the Users. We may unilaterally change the fee rates. Such changes and amendments shall come into effect from the day that such changes and amendments are published on the Website.</p>
                    <p>You acknowledge that it is your sole responsibility to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. We will make any tax withholdings or filings that we are required by law to make, but we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your profit, or for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from any of your actions.</p>
                    <p>We strongly recommend you consult your own accountant regarding taxes and make decisions based on your own risk tolerance.</p>
