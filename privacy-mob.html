                <h4>4. HOW AND WHY WE GATHER INFORMATION</h4>
                <p>When you register for an account for the Services or at any later time, we collect certain personal information from you to open an account, transact business, communicate with you, verify your identity and fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. We call this your “Profile.” From time to time, we may request additional information (e.g., through surveys) to help us further assess your needs and preferences.</p>
                <p>If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving Propbase the permission to use and store it consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may also obtain your personal information from your transactions with us or other Users through the Services, or from third parties such as credit reporting agencies. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that you provide directly to us through or in connection with the Services, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                
                <h4>5. COOKIES</h4>
                <p>When you visit the Website, whether or not you register for an account, we may send one or more cookies.</p>
                <div class="li-block">

                        <li><b>Cookies</b>: Small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters that may be placed on your web browser. Cookies make it easier for you to navigate our Website by, among other things, “remembering” your identity so that you do not have to input your password multiple times as you navigate between web pages on the Website and/or as you access the Services. This use of cookies for authentication (i.e., verifying that you are who you say you are) is an essential component of site security. You can set your web browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set.</li>
                        <li><b>Web Beacon</b>: Typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site or in an email which allows the website to record the simple actions of the user opening the page that contains the beacon.</li>
                        <li><b>Server Logs</b>: Can be either a single log file or several log files automatically created and maintained by a server of activity performed by the server, which can include information about any transaction you conduct with the server.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Please note that if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality or slower site response times. Declining to use our authentication-related cookies may prevent you from using the Website altogether.</p>
                <p>We or our service providers may also collect web surfing data related to your use of the Services (e.g., information regarding which of our web pages you access, the frequency of such access, and your product and service preferences).

You can share your profile with all other Users, or only with such other Users as are designated by you. You are not required to share your profile or any other information with other Users. If you do share your profile, anyone you designate will be able to see what companies you are following and investing in.</p>
                <p>If you indicate an interest in making an investment through the Services, such as indicating an interest to buy equity or make a loan in a particular private real estate company, we will notify the party or parties offering the investment (the “Issuer”) of your interest and may notify other Users with whom you have chosen to share information. By indicating an interest in an investment and/or sharing your Profile with other Users, you consent to this disclosure of your information. We may also collect and store information, which could include Non-Personally Identifiable Information orPersonally Identifiable Information, locally on your computer or device using mechanisms such as browser web storage or application data caches.</p>

                <h4>7. SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES</h4>
                <p>You can log in to the Website using social media services such as Google or Facebook. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, such as your name and email address, to pre-populate our sign-up form.</p>
                <p>Our Website may also include social sharing features for common social networks. These features are interactive mini-programs and may collect your IP address and the page you are visiting on our site. They may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>
                
                <h4>8. NOTIFICATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS</h4>
                <p>Propbase will send you email notifications from time to time. Some notifications are required elements of your transactions on our platform, such as confirmations of particular actions you have taken. These mandatory notices are sent typically to notify you of a change in status. For example, you will receive a notice when you are confirmed as an investor.</p>
                <p>We also send out notices that are required for legal or security purposes. For example, certain notifications are sent for your own protection to ensure that another person cannot make a change to your account without your knowledge. In other cases, these notifications involve changes to various legal agreements or Site policies. Generally, you may not opt out of such service-related emails.</p>
                <p>When you register as an investor, you will receive emails that confirm specific actions you requested. These will include emails to which you must respond to complete your registration and notifications confirming your registration. Thereafter, you will receive emails when a new investment opportunity is available on our platform, as well as updates concerning the progress of the funding of such investment and/or other relevant information. If you make an investment through the Site, Propbase will also send you confirmations of the investment as well as occasional updates as to the status of that investment and the timing of distributions relating to that investment.</p>
                <p>When you register as an investor and opt-in to Propbase’s SMS Communications program, you are consenting to receive text messages sent by an automatic telephone dialing system and acknowledge that data usage charges may apply by your cell phone company. You may receive text messages regarding system notifications, investment opportunity updates, and special offers and promotions, and can manage your opt-in status in your user profile.</p>
                <p>We may also send you responses to emails you send us, if appropriate. From time to time, we will also send user surveys, requests for user feedback regarding user experience and Site operations, or marketing offers from us or from us on behalf of our marketing partners. Completing these surveys, answering requests for feedback, or accepting any offer is strictly voluntary.</p>
                <p>Propbase will never send you an email asking you for your login information. In general, you can protect yourself against phishing by never providing personal or login information via a link contained in an email; instead, go to the website directly. You might also make it a habit to check the URL of a website to be sure that it begins with the correct domain. In the case of Propbase, you should always ensure the URL begins with <a href="https://www.propbase.app/" target="_blank">https://propbase.app</a> or <a href="https://www.propbase.app/" target="_blank">https://www.propbase.app</a></p>
                
                <h4>9. OPT-OUT POLICY</h4>
                <p>We may at times send you email communications with marketing or promotional materials. If you prefer not to receive such marketing or promotional emails from us, you may unsubscribe at any time. Please note that opt-out requests may take up to twenty-four (24) hours to process.</p>
                <p>Please also note that at times we may need to send you email communications that are transactional in nature, such as service or termination announcements or payment confirmations. You will not be able to opt out of these communications.</p>
                
                <h4>10. SECURITY NOTIFICATIONS</h4>
                <p>If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on or through the Site in the event of a security breach. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>

                <h4>11. WHERE YOU CAN VIEW AND CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
                <p>We urge you to review your information regularly to ensure that it is correct and complete. If you believe that any of your information is incorrect, or if you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@propbase.app.</p>

                <h4>12. DATA RETENTION POLICY</h4>
                <p>We will retain your data for as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide you with the Services. This includes information required to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. Here are some examples:</p>

                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>You can request to have your information deleted by contacting us at support@propbase.app. Please note that there may be exceptions to your deletion request, such as where information is necessary to comply with legal or regulatory obligations.</p>

                <h4>13. DATA SECURITY</h4>
                <p>We take the security of your data very seriously and employ a number of measures to protect it, including:</p>
                <div class="li-block">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encryption of data at rest and in transit</li>

                </div>
                <p>We are committed to protecting your information and will continue to invest in security measures to mitigate risks. However, no security system is perfect, and we cannot guarantee the security of your data.</p>

                <h4>14. THIRD-PARTY SHARING</h4>
                <p>We may share your data with third-party service providers who help us operate and improve the Services. These service providers may be located in different countries around the world.</p>
                <p>We will only share your data with third-party service providers who have agreed to comply with strict data privacy and security requirements. We will also enter into contracts with these service providers that limit their use of your data for the purpose of providing services to Propbase.</p>
                <p>We may also share your data with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
                <div class="li-block">
